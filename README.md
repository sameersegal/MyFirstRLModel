# My first RL model

Yipee! My first RL trained model. It bare bones and not very useful. We use Mistral 7B model and Reddit dataset (TLDR) to build a summarizer. The model get's a reward (or penalty) if the summary generated is different from 20 characters. The code was generated by ChatGPT. My goal was to run the entire setup on a 4xA100 machine. Given the simplistic nature of the reward model, its no surprise that the model hacks the reward.

# Developer

0. Setup Ubuntu dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.10-dev libaio-dev
```

1. Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Create the venv

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

3. Hugging Face login. Enter token on prompt.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

4. Weights & Biases (wandb) login. And set env variables

```bash
wandb login
export WANDB_PROJECT=myfirstrlmodel
export WANDB_NAME=run-${RANK}  
```

5. Configure accelerate

 ```bash
accelerate config
```

6. Run the training job

```bash
accelerate launch train.py
```

7. Graphs from the training run:

Note: This is not a decent run. But hey it looks cool.

8. Once the model is trained you will have files created in `mistral-grpo-demo`. You can then run `evaluate.ipynb` notebook

TITLE: How do you get someone out of your head?

POST: Hi,
I'm 22, and I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.

Problem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.

We decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. 

Now, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that. I would like for those feelings to go away, to leave me alone. But I can't.  

What do I do? It's been 3 months now, and I'm just desperate.

TL;DR:



Summary:

'ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”'

Note: It's a terrible model but we successfully changed the behavior of the Instruct model.
